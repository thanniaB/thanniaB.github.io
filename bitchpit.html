      This is a game idea I would like to do some day, but for this I don't have any drawings or sketches. <br/><br/>

One of my favorite videogame parts of all the games I've played it's Glitzville,
the third level from Paper Mario the thousand year door. If you haven't played it,
I'd recommend doing so, but if you still want me to spoil it, here's a quick recap:
 Glitzville is a fighting arena, a tournament in which Mario gets involved, but inbetween
 fights there's a mistery you slowly solve, which adds a lot to the coolness of the level.<br/><br/>

My idea is to do a whole game out of the Glitzville premise, a fighting tournament with
 stuff to do inbetween fights. BUT the setting would be high school and you had to climb
 the social ladder, specifically the female social ladder.<br/><br/>

Something like Mean Girls the game, you'd create your own teenage girl
(I find that it has to be a teenage girl instead of just a teenager to have
the feeling I want) and then you'd fight against stereotypes, the nerdy girl,
 the punk, the cheerleader, all to become the high school queen.<br/><br/>

The fights would be real time, not turn based, but I would like the idea of
being able to buy items and then use them in fight. And there would be some
mystery to solve in between fights.<br/><br/>
