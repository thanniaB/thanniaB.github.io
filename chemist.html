      In school they loved to give us projects that were "educational" and
      "useful" and by the end of my 5th semester the project I had to do was
      an educational videogame using XNA.<br/><br/>

But educational videogames usually mean boring stuff. The best are history
 based and the worst are spaceships doing sums. I wanted to do something different.<br/><br/>

I remembered joking with my brother about Pokemon having actual chemical
elements instead of "water" or "fire", so many games use this elements,
but none that I know use "hydrogen" or "Calcium". That's how Chemist was born.<br/><br/>

      Anna was a mad scientist, during one of her experiments she messed up and
       a lot of monsters were unleashed to the world, now she has to clean up
       what she did. The game is a beat 'em up, you control Anna and her powers
        vary with the chemical elements, there's a square on the HUD that
         displays what element you're using, and you change it with the
         controller bumpers. For example if you were using helium you'd be
          faster but weaker, if you were using iron heavier but stronger,
           also iron would be weak against oxygen. Enemies would have their
           elements to which would make their weaknesses and strengths, by
            killing them you'd get an "atom" of the element and (that part
            was left off the prototype) you could combine it and make more
            powerful chemicals to use as powers or maybe even as medicine.
<br/><br/>
  With the help of some friends I did a prototype in which you just
  fought infinite lions and could change your stats to some basic elements,
   it should be hosted on media fire somewhere, but no idea if it still works.
