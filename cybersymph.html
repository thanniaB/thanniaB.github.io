I made it for a class in late 2012, by then I was already on my now permanent
creative block, but I managed to draft out something. By then I was playing
Megaman 64 and Metal Gear Solid, so it was heavily influenced by both. </p>

Neon was an engineer that was part of some secret special force,
 but he deserted because he's actually evil and wants to destroy the city.
 In my dream future in which I can do anything I want, this would be a 3D
 sandbox stealth game in which you travel the city, avoid getting caught,
 collect parts, build machines, and then use them to destroy said city.
  Also boss battle your old force companions. I imagine the art heavily black and pink as well.  </p>
