      I don't know how the idea of this came to be, maybe it was at the bank,
      maybe at church, but it's the one on this list that has more chances
      (if any) of actually being done than the others. I was thinking about
      how love and hate are very strong forces in our lives and poof!
      "A game where you use love and hate as your powers".
<br/><br/>
  The game is a 2D platform action game, something like megaman, but with a sword, like megaman zero. </p>

  I decided the character to be male, because having a female lead would go
  with the stereotype that girls are sensible and stuff, that's why Sir Cancellot,
  the main character, is actually a very macho man.
<br/><br/>
  You go through 5 silly levels and you have a love-and-hate bar, depending
  on the position of the bar (love or hate) your attacks vary, also, some
   enemies are weaker to one or the other. You get different endings depending on how you finish it.</p>
