      This story has no name, and actually, no story either. <br/><br/>

The setting takes place decades after a zombie apocalypse hit the earth.
Stories about zombies are now legends and the new generations don't believe them,
 there is no more oil, remains of cars are used as shelter or as pieces to build stuff,
 there are no more guns produced, so the ones left are meant for the army and
 common people have to restore to swords, in a lot of ways life has gone back to be
  like in the past, but some other new technologies have emerged.<br/><br/>

It all starts in a village, a little kid has a great grandmother who was alive
at the time of the zombie apocalypse, she tells them stories and doesn't go to sleep
without a shotgun by her side, but almost everybody dismiss her as being senile.
The little kid then goes to play and wanders off away from the village, and eventually
finds the remains of an old zombie still alive trapped in a cave.<br/><br/>

The village is usually visited by missionaries, they ride horses, dress like
knights and the kids love them, they usually come once a year to teach the kids
and play with them, and give some help to the adults as well.
One of the missionaries is Scheiffer, a young noble man who is extremely servicial.
 Scheiffer is the little kid's favorite missionary and they end up going on the adventure together.<br/><br/>

    <p class="english">
      Scheiffer has a younger brother, Alan, who is a racing pilot of some electric
       vehicles developed in the future for entertainment. Alan is reckless and
       quite the opposite of Scheiffer, he's always resented how his older brother
        is all noble and everybody loves him, but agrees to help him on the quest.
        Scheiffer, on the other hand, thinks his brother is wasting away his life not
         doing something he finds useful, but loves him anyway.<br/><br/>

      At some point they need the help of The Blademaster, whose real name nobody knows.
      The Blademaster is an army veteran who specializes on all weapons but,
      despite her nickname, is far better with guns than with swords.
      She has a local weapon shop on the city, everybody thinks she's awesome and
      would love to be like her, but she actually despises her job.
      She wanted to be a rap star, but was forced to join the army at 18 when a
       war started since she was the oldest child, she spent years in the army
       away from her family and when she came back she found out her younger sister,
       Natalie, actually became a pop star, which led her to despise her for stealing her dream.<br/><br/>
